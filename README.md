# Gulp.js Project Template
This template is meant as a simple starting point for your front-end projects.

It supports jQuery, Bootstrap, and SCSS (Sass).

## Installation
Clone this git to your new project folder.

run `npm install` in your project folder to install all dependencies.

run `gulp` in your project folder to start the task manager.

## Usage
Development takes place within the `src`-folder.

When changes are made to either of the files inside `src` Gulp will compile your entire project and move it to the `build`folder.

Use the `build`-folder to view your work, and upload to your production server.
